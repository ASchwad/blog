# Alexander Schoenenwald

Hey! I'm Alex 👋

I'm a generalist software engineer focused on solving data problems.

For 8+ years, I've been working in fast-paced teams to build solutions end to end based on direct customer interaction. This means closely listening to customers and then turning their needs into designs, data models, data pipelines, backends and frontends.

It's what I did as a CTO in my own company, at BMW, at Palantir and today as a Freelancer building products in the Applied AI space.

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
