Helping farmers predict and prevent diseases in their livestock herds. We developed hardware, software, and machine learning models, scaling across 300+ farms in 20+ countries.

By founding and working on Futuro Farming over 4 years, I've learned what it means to **build**. Working on a complex product from the greenfield without any guidance and 100% ownership of the technical decisions around our software. Earning only the minimum to live and without a rewarding exit. But it was the most formative time of my career and I would do it again. During my time there I have worked on the following:

**Manufacturing & Assembly Tools:** Built software for sensor flashing, RF quality check protocols embedded in a mobile app for the assembly plant and interfaces with laser systems for housing labels.

**Cloud Infrastructure:** Owned our AWS stack including APIs, databases, data pipelines and machine learning services.

**Frontend Applications:** Led development of a B2B mobile app serving 300+ users across 20 languages, plus an internal admin dashboard for KPI tracking, customer support and UX validation.
