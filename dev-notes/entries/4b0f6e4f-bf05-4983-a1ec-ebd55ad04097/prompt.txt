IMPORTANT: As you work, track your tasks by writing to dev-notes/entries/4b0f6e4f-bf05-4983-a1ec-ebd55ad04097/tasks.json.
Format: { "todos": [{ "text": "task description", "done": false }] }
Update the file as you complete each task (set "done": true). This powers the live progress UI.
Example:
{
  "todos": [
    { "text": "Identify the issue", "done": true },
    { "text": "Fix the component", "done": false },
    { "text": "Run type-check", "done": false }
  ]
}

After completing your changes, commit with a descriptive message and push to the remote branch.
Run: git add -A && git commit -m "fix: <short description>" && git push
